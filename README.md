This eportfolio covered three parts of Computer Science: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithm and Data Structure, and Database. My focus in this final capstone is a little different. I chose the Data Science pathway as my future career because I like coding, but I do not like talking with only the computer every single day. I want to research, to learn, and to analyze data. Data is getting more and more important, and data scientists will be those to talk for the data, to explain them to other people, and scarily, influent people with data (through narratives). 

My eportfolio including three projects that I like (and also scare) the most: a mobile app for home/office storage management, a secure coding stack test project, and an analysis of the data from Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.

In the mobile app, I focus mainly on Google Firebase. While the course taught me to work with SQLite, I believe Google Firebase and other cloud-based database are the present and the future of mobile app, because no one would want the data to be used only in one phone. Just like Machine Learning now can be done on virtual computer for better performance, the future of Computer Science will be more and more depend on cloud system.

For the secure coding project, I finish everything that required to test the stack, from creating, deleting, popping, adding, etc. The main goal of this project is to boost my knowledge of secure coding, which was the hardest course at SNHU to me. Secure coding is one of the most important part of Computer Science in the history and will be in the future.

For database project, I re-analyze Bubba Gump’s data using Jupyter Notebook and Python, the core of Data Science nowadays. The data was shown and interpreted a lot easier and better with plots, coding, and comments. I also built a model to predict the most important features that affect the company’s revenue.

** Side notes**

Five years ago, I put away my dream of being a doctor to come to the U.S. with my family. Two and a half years ago, I was deciding between getting a bachelor or attending a coding bootcamp. Today, I am two weeks away from completing my degree and a month away from starting my first job as a Junior Software Engineer that I got after about 300 applications and one technical interview. This whole journey with SNHU, the knowledges I got, the frustration I had when I got stuck, and the support from everyone. It was a blessing, and I will never regret choosing SNHU as my undergrad school.
